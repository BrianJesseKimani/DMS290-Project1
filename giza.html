					<h3>History of the Population</h3>
					<img class="right two-fifths" src="images/nola-history.jpg" alt="New Orleans History">

					<p>
						Situated on a bend of the Mississippi River 100 miles from its mouth, New Orleans has been the chief city of Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexicoâ€™s busiest northern port since the early 1700s. Founded by the French, ruled for 40 years by the Spanish and bought by the United States in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans is known for its distinct Creole culture and vibrant history. Significant battles of the War of 1812 and the Civil War were fought over the city. In its last hundred years the key struggles of New Orleans have been social (poverty, racial strife) and natural (hurricanes, floods and slowly sinking land).

					<h3>Culture</h3>
					<img class="left two-fifths" src="images/nola-culture.jpg" alt="New Orleans Culture">
					<p>Unquestionably one of the most distinctive cities of the New World, the peoples of New Orleans evolved a unique culture and society, while at the same time blending many heritages such as African American, French and North American. Its citizens of African descent provided a special contribution in making New Orleans the birthplace of jazz. New Orleans is a city of paradox and contrast: while it shares the urban problems afflicting other U.S. cities, it has nevertheless preserved an exuberant and uninhibited spirit, perhaps best exemplified by its Carnival season, which culminates in the famous annual Mardi Gras, when more than a million people throng the streets.</p>

				<h2>Economy</h2>
				<section class="subsection"> <!--economy-->
					<h3>Tourism the Driving Force!</h3>
					<img class="left two-fifths" src="images/nola-economy.jpg" alt="New Orleans Tourism">

					<p>The New Orleans economy is dominated by four major sectors: oil/gas and related activities, tourism, the port and ship/boat building, and aerospace manufacturing. The presence of universities, hospitals, legal/accounting and other professional services, together with key installations of the U.S. Navy and other military operations in the region adds further to its diversified economic base. Tourism continues to be the driving force of New Orleans' economy. Boasting attractions such as its magnetic French Quarter, America's largest Mardis Gras festival, and river-boat gambling, New Orleans has a history of solid tourist trade. In a city with more than 10 million visitors annually, the hospitality business supplies more than 66,000 jobs in the service sector such as accommodations and restaurants. In 2004, tourists spent $4.9 billion in New Orleans.
