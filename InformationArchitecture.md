## Choreography

The Website will have a landing page with Images referencing the Cities available for exploration. The cities will be ordered according to their geographic locations from continent to continent. We will start with the most west of the world continent which would be the Americas and move eastwards. If two cities are in the same continent they will be arranged in order of the closest one to the previous city explored. Each city will have its webpage with the info laid out in the order described in the taxonomy.
