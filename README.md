# DMS290-Project1

Vikram
1) New Orleans has the scaffolding per information architecture chosen.
2) Visual design should be updated per visual designer's recommendations.
3) Other three cities are drafts based on New Orleans.  They must be updated with the content from DMS 290 - Assignment 03 (rochester.edu) and additional content from the web.
4) extra credit - use java script or php to show selected page menu item - look at the styles.css and script.js from the gotham project for example.  Extra credit is for php? not sure if java script will get you credit but try.  I dont know php.
